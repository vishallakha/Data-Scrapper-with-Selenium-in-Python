## Description
I have written Selenium code in Python which can scrap any type of data from any website(dynamic as well as static).

It uses Chrome Driver, and waits for given time till an object of a certain class is loaded completely. then it finds all relevant data related to a class name and appends the output in a proper list. This code has the potential to used in any scenario where data needs to be scraped from external sources.
